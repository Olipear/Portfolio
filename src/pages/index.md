about:
  aboutbody: >-
    I currently live in Leamington Spa with my partner Merle, and cat Mushu. 


    I keep up 3D work as a hobby, and I'm slowly learning to use it for concept art along with digital painting.


    I enjoy board games, both in cafes and, more recently, online. I have a game night at least once a fortnight with my friends.
