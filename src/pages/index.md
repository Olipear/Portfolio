about:
  aboutbody: >-
    Currently living in Leamington spa with my partner Merle and cat Mushu. 

    I read a lot of sci-fi in a never-ending search for a series as good as Hyperion. 

    I keep up 3D work as a hobby, I'm slowly learning to use it for concept art along with digital painting. Occasionally I'll start yet another game project in unity.

    I enjoy both PC gaming and board games, I tend to have a game night at least once a fortnight with something like Carcassonne.
