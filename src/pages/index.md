  - blurb: I take digital products from research and requirements gathering, all the
      way through to protoyping and development.

      project, or need someone who can bring your design and dev teams together,
      look no further.
about:
  aboutbody: >
    I currently live in Leamington Spa with my partner Merle. I carry on with
    computer animation as a hobby, practicing with 3D models to create concept
    art. I like to read science fiction and create sci-fi artwork, I find work
    of Simon St√•lenhag a great inspiration and you'll probably see his work on
    my desktop backgrounds.
