about:
  aboutbody: >-
    Currently living in Leamington spa with my partner Merle and cat Mushu. 

    I read a lot of sci-fi in a never-ending search for something as good as Hyperion. 

    Keep up some 3D work as a hobby, I'm slowly learning to use for concept work along with digital painting. 

    I'm into games, having a board game night at least every fortnight with games Carcassonne.
