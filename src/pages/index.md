  - blurb: I take digital products from research and requirements gathering, all the
      way through to protoyping and development.
  - blurb: So whether you're looking for a flexible team member on a fast moving
      project, or need someone who can bring your design and dev teams together,
      look no further.
about:
  aboutbody: >-
    Currently living in Leamington spa with my partner Merle and cat Mushu. 

    I like to read sci-fi, still looking for a book that comes close to Hyperion. 

    I'm slowly learning to make concept art with 3D models and digital painting, I'm a fan of artists like Simon Stalenhag. 

    Board games beat video games every time but I'm partial to both, carcassonne is my favourite at the moment.
