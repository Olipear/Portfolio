about:
  aboutbody: Whilst studying at Bournemouth University I started a temporary position at a small company called Avius. Nearly 4 years later I'd graduated and the company turnedover it's first million! I'd been creating custom user interfaces for clients during my time there, but I began to get into front-end development as time went on. When I left avius I went on to work for TTi-Global on their Jaguar-Landrover eLearning courses, initially as a contracter, but shortly after I moved to Warwick to take up a full time position. Unfortunately TTi-Global closed their Leamington office only 9 months after, I then took the lead 'UX developer' role at Vitsoe. Working within a very small team, we transformed several areas of the digital business; from the internal wharehousing systems to the customer-facing website. I've now left Vitsoe and I'm back in the freelance game, after the madness of 2020, I'm looking rebalance my work and life, spend more time in the garden and on the sofa with my cat, mushu, and partner, Merle.
