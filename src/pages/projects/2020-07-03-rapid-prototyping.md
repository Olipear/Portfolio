      #### Background


      The existing planning tool was a desktop app, written in Java in 2001. Not only was the interface and output outdated aesthetically, it meant that customers could not directly plan their shelving system themselves. A salesperson needed to use the existing 'planning tool' to create something the customer might want to buy. 


      Needless to say, even well before the commencement of this project, I had done a great deal of research into the myriad of problems this created for both the customer and business.


      * Customers found it frustrating that they could not estimate price without going through this process. 

      * Many just wanted to buy the components themselves without this process.

      * The process took a long time, on average, there was 3 months between initial inquiry and purchase.
  - heading: Wireframing and design
    intro: After identifying some of the key use cases and looking closely at how
      our competitors handled similar UI challenges I moved on to creating
      several wireframes
