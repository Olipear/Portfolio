      Sales of Vitsoe's 620 chair and footstool product we relatively low. The
      majority of sales were happening in their retail spaces or via direct
      communication with planners.


      Due to the product's nature, this isn't especially unusual, since most people would want to sit in one before purchase. However, since Vitsoe only operated 4 physical shops worldwide, improving online sales was important.

  - heading: Immediate improvements
    intro: >-
      The existing product page had clear problems that I identified could be
      vastly improved with simple CSS and markup changes. These changes took an
      afternoon to make, but could make a significant improvement without
      needing to have gone through the usual design process. 


      I also used this as a way of testing my initial assumptions about why the product page was performing poorly, and feed any findings into my design process.

      - subheading: Initial quick fixes
        body: >-
          * The line drawing of the chair at the top displayed multiple sides of
          the product, but it took up the entire screen. I simply changed the
          size of this and made the actual configurator center stage.

          * The widget at the top of the screen showed the chair turn into a sofa, however this was a complete duplication of the configurator towards the end, minus the button overlays. Since it was still just a line drawing, it wasn't providing the customer any more information, so it was removed entirely. 

          * Another final things??

    intro: Now I'd fixed some of the more obvious problems I started to look at
      larger improvements that could be made.
    subsections:
      - subheading: Competitor evaluation
        body: >-
          At almost £7000, the 620 chair really had one main competitor, the
          much better known 'Eames chair', retailing at around £5000. The other
          key competition were from places like Made.com, and other designer
          outlets. However even the most expensive chairs from sites like
          Made.com were not directly competing, so I broadened my search to
          include other high end luxury good. 


          Since another relatively unique feature of the 620 was it's customisation options, I found the luxury car market to be good case studies to look to.

The SCAA updated the wheel to reflect the finer nuances needed to describe flavors more precisely. The new descriptions are more detailed and hence allow cuppers to distinguish between more flavors.

While this is going to be a big change for professional coffee tasters, it means a lot to you as a consumer as well. We’ll explain how the wheel came to be, how pros use it and what the flavors actually mean.

## What the updates mean to you

The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA), founded in 1982, is a non-profit trade organization for the specialty coffee industry. With members located in more than 40 countries, SCAA represents every segment of the specialty coffee industry, including:

* producers
* roasters
* importers/exporters
* retailers
* manufacturers
* baristas

For over 30 years, SCAA has been dedicated to creating a vibrant specialty coffee community by recognizing, developing and promoting specialty coffee. SCAA sets and maintains quality standards for the industry, conducts market research, and provides education, training, resources, and business services for its members.

Coffee cupping, or coffee tasting, is the practice of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffee. It is a professional practice but can be done informally by anyone or by professionals known as "Q Graders". A standard coffee cupping procedure involves deeply sniffing the coffee, then loudly slurping the coffee so it spreads to the back of the tongue.

The coffee taster attempts to measure aspects of the coffee's taste, specifically the body (the texture or mouthfeel, such as oiliness), sweetness, acidity (a sharp and tangy feeling, like when biting into an orange), flavour (the characters in the cup), and aftertaste. Since coffee beans embody telltale flavours from the region where they were grown, cuppers may attempt to identify the coffee's origin.
