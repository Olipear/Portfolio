description: In selling this design icon I went for an adaptive interface design
  and was very sucessful in improving sales. I also had fun making those lovely
  renders!

      Sales of Vitsoe's 620 chair and footstool product we relatively low. The
      majority of sales were happening in their retail spaces or via direct
      communication with planners.


      Due to the product's nature, this isn't especially unusual, since most people would want to sit in one before purchase. However, since Vitsoe only operated 4 physical shops worldwide, improving online sales was important.

  - heading: Immediate improvements
    intro: >-
      The existing product page had clear problems that I identified could be
      vastly improved with simple CSS and markup changes. These changes took an
      afternoon to make, but could make a significant improvement without
      needing to have gone through the usual design process. 


      I also used this as a way of testing my initial assumptions about why the product page was performing poorly, and feed any findings into my design process.

        body: >-
          * The line drawing of the chair at the top displayed multiple sides of
          the product, but it took up the entire screen. I simply changed the
          size of this and made the actual configurator center stage.

          * The widget at the top of the screen showed the chair turn into a sofa, however this was a complete duplication of the configurator towards the end, minus the button overlays. Since it was still just a line drawing, it wasn't providing the customer any more information, so it was removed entirely. 

          * Another final things??

    intro: Now I'd fixed some of the more obvious problems I started to look at
      larger improvements that could be made.
    subsections:
      - subheading: Competitor evaluation
        body: >-
          At almost £7000, the 620 chair really had one main competitor, the
          much better known 'Eames chair', retailing at around £5000. The other
          key competition were from places like Made.com, and other designer
          outlets. However even the most expensive chairs from sites like
          Made.com were not directly competing, so I broadened my search to
          include other high end luxury good. 


          Since another relatively unique feature of the 620 was it's customisation options, I found the luxury car market to be good case studies to look to.
