    intro: "As Vitsoe's most accessible product in terms of price point, the 621
      table was a gateway product that led on to further sales. "

      #### Background


      After a redesign and initially successful relaunch, the 621 table had been plagued by supply and stock issues throughout 2018. Sales in shops were being maintained, since it was a lower priced item (comparative to their other products), whilst online orders were dropping away.


      #### Objectives


      Throughout my time at Vitsoe my brief was broadly unchanged, improving online sales. The 621 table was the first product I was asked to look at. This meant the UX process I went through here was the most comprehensive, and would inform my later work on their other products.

    intro: One of the first things I implemented when starting out at Vitsoe was
      google analytics, and custom events tracking.
    body: >-
      #### Resources


      At the commencement of this project I had around 6 months of google analytics data, and access to years worth of sales figures. 


      There were some large gaps that I'm aware could have significantly improved my UX process. Social media marketing was untracked, email promotions did not use trackable links, and I would not have access to customers for interviews, focus groups or user testing. 


      My window to the customer was via the sales teams, I used experienced salespeople to better understand customer motivations and frustrations. 


      #### Personas


      The UX personas I created involved a lot of collaboration with the most experienced Vitsoe salespeople. I used website acquisition and device statistics to decide what technology they used. The majority of Vitsoe customers used apple products for example. 


      TODO: insert personas here 


      These were representative of both Vitsoe's existing customer base, and their target market. The 606 shelving system is Vitsoe's main product, so they are focused on that, with relevant information like their living situation. 


      I could then adapt these base personas where needed for a specific project. For example, in the base persona Hans owns a shelving system from a competitor, and want to purchase additional components from Vitsoe. For this 621 table project he would own a 620 chair from a competitor and want to buy the table to accompany it.


      #### Acquisition


      The user journey begins long before they enter the website. I looked at where we were getting our visitors from, and how many. If people weren't seeing or hearing about Vitsoe's products, changes I made on the website couldn't be effective. 


      TODO: insert acquisition stats here


      Vitsoe had a healthy volume site visitor numbers overall, I passed along social media sites and publications that we being particularly effective for us. 


      When I drilled down into where these vitistors were, I found that a 20% were entering to the 'good design page', which explained Dieter Rams's 10 principles of good design. Heatmap research had been conducted 3 years previously, shortly after the section was redesigned. This found that a majority of visitors were coming to copy-paste the principles, and visitors were mostly product design students learning about Dieter Rams. I saw that 80% of visitors to the page didn't visit any other part of the website. 


      #### Conflicting business goals


      Vitsoe wanted to be 'the gatekeeper for Dieter Rams'. Large portions of the website are taken up with the career, history and philosophy of the designer's work. These pages were ranked at the top of search engines for 'Dieter Rams', driving a huge volume of traffic to the site. 


      Furthermore, the company has a digital magazine 'Vitsoe voice', collection of lifestyle and design articles. Many featured vitsoe products, but they would often be features on an interesting Vitsoe customer, or Rams's design philosophy. 


      All of this drove traffic to the site, but I found that in many instances it conflicted with the goals to use the site for e-commerce applications. 


      TODO: Insert homepage.


      Vitsoe Voice prominence on the homepage was clearly confusing the perception of Vitsoe as a retailer, and the behaviour tracking backed this up. After the good design page the homepage was the 2nd largest entry point, a quarter of users bounced, of those remaining only just over half moved on to view product pages. Most of the remainder were visiting sections on Dieter Rams. 


      Despite taking pride of place on the homepage, only 4% of visitors were interested in reading Vitsoe Voice. When I looked further at Vitsoe Voice, I found that the overwhelming majority of readers were coming directly, and pageviews spiked whenever the company released a newsletter to existing customers.


      This was further evidenced when I looked at conversion ratio vs pageviews to vitsoe voice. 


      DOTO: insert diagram here


      Spikes in Vitsoe voice were correlating with dips in conversion rate; indicating that these vitisors were less likely to make a purchase and were most probably existing customers. 


      #### Site behaviour


      Now looking closer at the 621 area, split into four pages, I found this to be a microcosm of the larger issues I'd found. 


      TODO: add diagram of original page structure in 621 


      Links from elsewhere on the site pointed at the introduction section, and with the path /621, it was also the most popular entry point for organic searches for the table. Of the 70% that didn't leave the site entirely, less than half visited other pages within the 621 area.


      Prominent links took users away of the 621 area entirely, out to pages about Dieter's career and the good design page. 


      Overall just 9% of users who reached one of the other 621 pages ever saw the buy page. 


      With what I had seen on the rest of the site, I was concerned that a user would not even realise the there were products available for purchase. Focusing so heavily on the design, history and philosophy behind the product made it easy to mistake these pages as purely informational.


      It also seemed that there was also an issue with the sheer volume of information here. I could see from several metrics most users weren't reaching the end of the page let alone actually reading all this information.


      #### Purchase page


      The purchase page was commonly the last page in a user journey, where customers were making a purchase decision. Few people went back to gallery and detail pages, but this was likely because they had already had an opportunity to see these. Of course those who deliberated longer and spent a lot of time circling through the various pages were much more likely to make a purchase. 


      The UI itself was well laid out. 90% of those that didn't bounce interacted with the customisation controls, so their purpose seemed to be clear enough. 


      Few complaints about the product were passed on to me from sales teams, so I was happy that the studio photography was accurately portraying the product.

      #### Making the product center of attention


      Having demonstrated the issues with having Vitsoe Voice front and center of the homepage, this was the first problem to solve. 


      TODO: insert homepage mockup here. 


      This proposed layout only needed to shift UI elements around, meaning it carried a low development cost. 


      Even moving it to the bottom of the page, I never discounted the value the editorial had. I used tracking of ecommerce conversion to highlight specific articles that were driving sales, even with what appeared to be existing customers. Unsurprisingly, articles that featured products were better at driving sales.


      I also built the marketing team a dashboard in Google Data Studio so they could see how effective their newsletters, social media, and articles were at driving sales.




      #### Fixing the user journey


      The existing structure was laid out perfectly for users who would visit each page, read all the content contained, and move onto the next section. In reality users tend not to do this. 


      TODO: insert UX design page here. 


      Essentially my strategy was to simplify, following Dieter's own rules, anything that was not strictly supporting the products function should be removed. 


      The video wasn't being viewed, and much of the information contained in the pages were duplications. So mostly content was removed, without  the loss information. 


      With the introduction page now redundant, I also changed the landing page for /621, all the links on the site would now go directly to the purchase page. The design and details page was there, but now in support of the buy page the users decision to make a purchase. 


      #### Gallery content


      The galleries were important for building aspiration, but also played a role in the 621's gateway strategy. Gallery images predominantly featured other vitsoe products alongside the table itself.


      All the gallery pages at the time had images both in a list view, but also had a gallery lightbox which allowed users to scroll through the content. The lightbox was being used to view the images by the majority of visitors, and here I saw the opportunity to remove another lengthy page. 


      Taking the existing functionality of the existing lightbox, and inserting it into the buy page, meant the users could view them without leaving. 


      I had wireframed a couple of layouts for this on paper, this was the only design to be mocked up in high fidelity.


      TODO: insert page design


      A risky design decision was made here, the wireframes I had came down to having the gallery as a separate element or merging it with the existing product visualisation element. 


      This question is exactly what A/B and user testing is for, but neither of these were options I had. I would need to decide on one approach and see if it worked. 


      My main concern was that even with good iconography and labeling, a user would reasonably expect a lightbox to open larger versions of the studio photography. 


      On the other hand having the gallery image separate could reduce visibility of links to the design and detail page, product dimensions, or the useful delivery, payments and returns policy links. If it were placed below these, it would less visible itself. 


      With the benefit of hindsight, the removal of the gallery should have been a change which followed on later. Even without A/B testing being functionally available on the website, making this changes separately would have made it easier to measure its effects.

      was having at each stage, I continued to make improvements to the initial
      design. "

      #### Acquisition


      Instagram was prioritised by the company as I had shown that the ecommerce conversion rate was significantly higher from these sources. 


      When I compared the four months either side of the homepage and 621 area changes being launched:


      * Vitsoe Voice readership was slightly higher. As my research showed, it was mostly being read by existing customers, so moving it further down the page did not damage it. 

      * Navigation from the homepage to product pages only increased by 2%. In raw numbers this account for an additional ~4,000 pageviews for 612.

      * Views for the buy page increased by 535%, and all key page metrics improved significantly.


      The direct affect these changes made on sales was very difficult to measure.


      TODO: insert chart of sales


      This graph looks fantastic on the face of it. However adding context shows how the changes I made might not be fully responsible for the increase in sales.


      TODO: insert chart of sales with annotations


      Improving the user experience on the website didn't end the production problems the company had, and the refocusing of marketing efforts could easily have had a larger impact. 


      Looking at this further in the future using much longer time periods would make this more clear. However the website behaviour data I had seemed to indicate what I'd done was working. 


      #### Galleries


      I was aware the decision to double up gallery functionality with the product visualisation was a gamble. When I implemented the changes I made sure that opening, and navigating through the lightbox would trigger custom events. 


      In the four months before and after launching the changes; there were 9,780 unique events for opening the gallery vs 1,254 unique pageview for the previous pageviews. An increase of 780%!


      This was of course mostly because the page the lightbox was in had also had a large increase in views. So I also looked at the % of pageviews that resulted in a gallery open event. Excluding those who bounced, 95% of users opened the gallery lightbox. 


      In this instance the gamble paid off.


      I would later make further improvements to the gallery, and updated the custom icon to the material design gallery icon - along with using material design icons across other areas of the site.


      TODO: add gallery lightbox screenshot. 


      This redesign could have a project write up of its own. But importantly, even though it was made a year later, I was still using the research I did for this project. Adding social media sharing links to allow users to save it on their pinterest board.
