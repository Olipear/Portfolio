    intro: "As Vitsoe's most accessible product in terms of price point, improving
      sales of 621 could see improvements across their business. "

      #### Background


      After a redesign and initially successful relaunch, the 621 table had been plagued by supply and stock issues throughout 2018. Sales in shops were being maintained, since it was a lower priced item (comparative to their other products), whilst online orders were dropping away.


      #### Objectives


      Throughout my time at Vitsoe my brief was broadly unchanged, improving online sales. The 621 table was the first product I was asked to look at. This meant the UX process I went through here was the most comprehensive, and would inform my later work on their other products.
