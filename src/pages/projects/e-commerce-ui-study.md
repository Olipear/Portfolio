    intro: >
      Vitsoe relied on its physical retail spaces for most of the sales of their
      620 chair and footstool. Online purchases were often preceded by a shop
      visit.
    body: >-
      #### Business goals


      * Increase sales of their 620 chair & footstool.

      * Shift existing sales online.

      * Reduce reliance on salespeople for sales, answer customer questions online.

      * Update the interface to allow the addition of a new upholstery option.

    intro: "I started by looking for where the experience needed improvement. "

      #### Pain points


      I collaborated with sales teams across the company to get an idea of what they were being asked, and why customers were choosing to order  through them rather than online. 


      * The modularity of the chair was poorly understood.

      * Customers expected the leather to be more uniform, in fact it had many natural patterns/ scarring. 

      * Some customers were surprised by colour when they received the product.

      * Customers couldn't buy a footstool one it's own.


      #### Source


      ![Previous buy page for the 620 chair](/img/original-page-landing.jpg "Previous buy page for the 620 chair")


      This was the is what a customer is first presented with when they click 'configure and buy'.


      ### Poor product visualisation was at the heart of it.


      * The line drawing was not suitable for visualising a Â£6.5k product.

      * The line drawing took up far too much screen space, the configuration options were not visible without scrolling.

      * The photography available was not visible unless it was selected below the main image. 

      * The footstool could only be added to a chair purchase, and had no photography at all. 


      #### Purchase journeys


      Low sales meant it was practical to look at each purchase journey over a year long period. 


      * Most purchasers would spend weeks deliberating over their purchase, returning to the site many times.

      * During this deliberation the gallery page was the most commonly visited.

      * Users would 'play' with the colour configurations after viewing the gallery. It seemed like they were getting ideas for colour combinations from the gallery over the configurator. 

      * No purchases were made on mobile, but the gallery was popular for purchasers.


      #### User behaviour


      * Most users were not interacting with the configuration options.

      * Users that did configure the chair often stopped after adding an additional seat. - possibly because adding a seat more than doubles the price. 

      * Most users, even purchasers would spend a very brief time on the informational pages accompanying the purchase page. 


      #### Key points to address


      * New product visualisations would be needed. 

      * Photography was needed for colour and texture decisions.

      * The footstool should have it's own configuration page.

      * The configurator needed to show the modularity and customisation options of the chair; without relying on other supporting pages.

      * Adding additional seats should be the last part of any staged, or segmented purchase process.

    intro: From the user stories and research I had a clear list of features to be
      included in the new UI.

      #### Product visualisation


      Existing images on the buy page were the only product photography available. Business stakeholders were advised that new photography, or renders were required.


      ### Our team created a [quick proof of concept](http://620poc.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/), in order to assess the practicality a product spinner.


      ![Screenshots of proof of concept](/img/620-poc.jpg "Screenshots of proof of concept")


      * Rendering 3D models in-browser couldn't achieve the quality we were looking for. 

      * Most libraries couldn't support the level of customisation we needed. Using React was the easiest way of building this functionality.

      * There would be a lot of images per rotation, so optimisation would be crucial.


      It was decided that renders would be preferable to photography, mainly for cost reasons. 


      #### Initial wireframes


      ![Initial wireframing of the 620 configurator](/img/620-initial-wireframes.jpg "Initial wireframing of the 620 configurator")


      Staging the process was decided to be too restrictive for users. It might stand in the way of customers understanding the modular nature of the product.


      Condensing the controls was another option explored, this would allow the visualisation to be shown alongside the configuration controls.


      #### Prototyping


      ![Prototypes for mobile version](/img/620-prototypes.jpg "Prototypes for mobile version")


      Accordions were too small, and required a lot of scrolling. Using a scrollable area with a single accordion didn't improve any of this, but made it harder to scroll. 


      It became clear that a larger area should be available for the controls.


      ![Prototype for mobile version](/img/620-prototypes-2.jpg "Prototype for mobile version")


      Switching between a configurator view, and a product view lead me to use modal overlays. 


      ![Mockup of modal design for mobile devices](/img/620-prototype.gif "Mockup of modal design for mobile devices")


      Scrolling up and down is much higher effort than tapping a button, this seemed to be a good compromise. 


      * All customisation options are shown to the user

      * The additional space using a fullscreen overlay could be used to include product photography

      * Providing this close up photography when selecting colour, would provide the user with much better material and texture information on the product.

      * The modal buttons followed existing visual language used elsewhere on the site. 


      ![Mockup of desktop modal design](/img/intermediate-prototype-desktop.jpg "Mockup of desktop modal design")


      The modal for colour choices was carried over to the desktop because of the advantage a close up photograph provided. Desktop offered additional space to include shell and upholstery colour in one modal. 


      This wasn't necessary for the the back and feet options. It made more sense to represent these as addons, and use checkboxes here.

    intro: "Now the final design and major features were agreed it was time to start
      building. "

      #### Technology


      From the earlier prototype the team had agreed how the new configurator would be built. 


      * We would build it as a self-contained React app, and use typescript.

      * It should scale to work on other configurable products in Vitsoe's range

      * Images would be managed outside of the CMS


      #### Data transport design


      ![Snapshot of whiteboard showing ideas for data transport structure](/img/620-data-transport-whiteboard.jpg "Whiteboard excerpt showing discussion of data transport structures")


      The structure we came up with described a product and contained all of the information our front-end would need.


      #### Adaptive, data driven UI


      ![](/img/components-split.jpg)


      The data structure dictates which component to render, for example any product with colour customisation would use the same colour picker component. This format could then be scaled later to be used on any other vitsoe product. 


      #### Optimisation


      From the earlier prototype we knew optimisation of the large number of images would be challenging. 


      ![Diagram of image optimisation technique](/img/image-load-order.jpg "Diagram of image optimisation technique")


      Rendering out to multiple resolutions allowed me to implement lazy loading. With 16 images per rotation, loading these simultaneously took far too long. A custom implementation needed to be used which managed the order in which images loaded.


      ![Animation showing the responsiveness of the spinner when loading](/img/620-image-loading.gif "Animation showing the responsiveness of the spinner when loading")


      This loading strategy was highly effective, users could interact with the spinner immediately after changing a customisation option. A small loading bar was added along the top of the frame so that users are aware images are loading.


      #### For developers


      If you have react devtools installed you can check out my component structure on the live site.

    heading: Testing
    intro: This round of usability testing was important for evaluating and
      finalising the spinner functionality.
    headerimage: /img/outcomes.png
    body: >-
      #### Methodology


      Starting from the home page of the site I asked them to buy specific configurations of chairs, footstools and sofas. After observing them complete the tasks, I asked them a few simple questions about the product, such as whether specific combinations were possible (e.g. swivel bases are not compatible with sofa configurations).


      #### Findings


      Overall the feedback was very positive. Most users were quick to complete the tasks, and could answer my questions.


      * One user completed the task without interacting with the spinner at all, not realising it was interactive. This resulted in the addition of the 3D icon in the lower left corner. 

      * During device testing I found on the smallest devices the confirm button in modals was not visible without scrolling. I decided to move this to the top of the screen so that it would always be visible, and in the same place.

      * The switch to the the footstool in the top left was often mis-tapped on touch devices. It was too small, and too close to the modal buttons. Since the footstool was linked both on other pages, and beneath the chair configurator, we decided to remove this.


      #### Further results


      As the last project I completed at Vitsoe, I don't have the usual follow up data I would need to properly assess it. Therefore I've kept this write-up focused on the UI design and development of the configurator.
